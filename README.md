Know your Food (KNF) is a highly secured software system that aims to resolve the trackability issues of the current Food Supply Chain.
The proposed solution also solves at length the issues regarding compromised Food quality due to excessive use of fertilizers at the production end and adulteration at supplier end.
The proposed solution uses the concept of Blockchain, a secure distributed ledger, to store details of the seed and fertilizer qualities used for a particular produce of food grains. Blockchain allows the participants to collaborate and work effectively in a trustless environment. This system ensures provenance as the information is traceable and transparency is maintained thus providing food quality assurance to the end users.

At each stage of the Food Supply Chain the authorized personnel at that level adds data in the blockchain by creating a transaction. Currently, the prototype provided connects two major ends, the Farmers or the Producers and the Consumers. The farmer are responsible for entering their Aadhaar information, the retailer to which the food is to be taken, the food item, the seed name,  seed grade, fertilizer name, fertilizer grade and finally the value of the Electrochemical Sensor(ECSensor). If the user, wants to traceback the source of his food, he can do so by entering the Retailer Name, Retailer number and the food item like Rice, Wheat etc. This will provide him with all the logs through which his product has been through along with the Seed grade and the food grade. Even before buying, he can check the history of the product.
